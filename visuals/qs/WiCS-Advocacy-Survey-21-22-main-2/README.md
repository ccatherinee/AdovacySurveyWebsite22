# Getting Started with Dash

I think everybody has Dash installed (hopefully LOL)...? If not, please Slack me! (error will be in the form of: command not found, etc.) <br/>

1. Navigate to the 2021_Visualizations folder <br/>
2. Execute `python qXX.py` and replace XX with the corresponding number <br/>

# Troubleshooting

Try executing `pip install XX` if you get an error along the lines of `XX not found`. <br/>
If you execute `python --version` and get Python 2.x.x., execute `python3 qXX.py` instead. <br/>
