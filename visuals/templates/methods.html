              The 2020 WiCS Advocacy Survey gathered over three hundred responses from Harvard College students who were enrolled during the Fall 2020 semester. The survey was released through Qualtrics on October 20th, 2020 and closed on October 31st, 2020. Students received individualized links to the survey through their Harvard College email address and could therefore only complete the survey once. All survey responses were then automatically anonymized through Qualtrics upon submission. The survey was also publicized over Harvard College email lists and forums. As part of our promotional efforts, WiCS donated $1 for every survey response, with the donation split between Black Girls Code, Out in Tech, and Code2040. The distribution of the 2020 WiCS Advocacy Survey was also aided by SEAS.

              In terms of gender, 129 respondents (41.3%) identified as male and 179 respondents (57.4%) identified as non-male. Among CS primary concentrators, 30 respondents (43.5%) identified as male and 37 respondents (53.6%) identified as non-male, indicating that our sample was most likely over-representative of non-male CS concentrators. Despite this sampling bias, our report still reveals valuable findings regarding how gender impacts student experiences in CS and remains mindful of this bias within its analysis.

              In terms of race and ethnicity, 117 respondents (37.5%) identified as Asian, 40 respondents (12.8%) identified as Black or African American, 33 respondents (10.6%) identified as Hispanic or Latinx, and 165 respondents (52.9%) identified as White. Among primary CS concentrators, 31 respondents (44.9%) identified as Asian, 13 respondents (18.8%) identified as Black or African American, 5 respondents (7.2%) identified as Hispanic or Latinx, and 26 respondents (37.7%) identified as White. Because respondents were able to select more than one race or ethnicity when answering this question, our report will double count responses from multiracial individuals where appropriate (i.e. when examining responses within a single racial or ethnic category). It is also worth noting that to preserve the privacy of the respondents, data analysis is omitted if the number of respondents within a demographic category (or within a given intersection of demographic categories) is less than five. Additionally, written results are only considered significant if the calculated p-value from a z-score test for two population proportions is less than 0.05.
